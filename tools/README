In "tools" directory:

Automated image resizing:

1. Create new directory "to_resize" and put there images.
2. Create new directory "resized".
3. Run script 'resize.py' in console.

Image labeler:

1. Create directory "source_to_label" and put there images.
2. Run script 'label_data.py'
3. Program is not fault tolerant (if you make mistake you have to remove it manually or start from the beginning).
4. Thus, a good aproach to use this labeler is dividing data into batches and labeling them in batches.

Generate masks of objects (segmentation) for object which are located by coordinations:

1. Put .csv file in dataset_augmented/data0 directory.
2. Run script gereate_output_mask.py
3. In dataset_mask_output/x and dataset_mask_output/y will be placed input image with expected mask respectively.
